# machine-actionable Software Management Plan Ontology (maSMP Ontology)

<h3>About</h3>

We have defined a metadata schema in the form of an ontology representing the necessary metadata elements for a maSMP. The metadata schema includes entities involved in software management planning; such as an SMP itself, software source code, software release, documentation, authors and their relations. We are reusing terms mainly from [schema.org] (https://schema.org/) and from [DCSO] (https://github.com/RDA-DMP-Common/RDA-DMP-Common-Standard), with some few additions of our own. This ontology is still work-in-progress, it does not correspond yet to a stable version.
